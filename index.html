    <header><h1>The Path to Project Management</h1></header>
    For my final lab I wanted to look into a specific career that I was interested in following my time in MI 349. After looking more into this role, I wanted to describe it’s purpose and how I could get there. As a project manager, I would be doing just that: Managing projects. In the scope of web design. I would be responsible for working to determine the scope of the project, manage a team of engineers and other cross-functional peers, and finally maintain a relationship with the client. 
    From my research, it seems that there are two ways that one can become a project manager:
<ol>
    <li><bold>The traditional route:</bold> Many people become a project manager through certifications and continued education. For this, you can get a Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM). This is a certification that I can already get after graduation with my IT minor. There is another certification called Project Management Professional (PMP). The difference between the two certifications are the level of expertise needed to attain these, and the relative responsibilities you are given in each position. As an Associate Project Manager, you will still be working with a full Project Manager for nearly 2,000 hours before you can get a PMP certification which will allow for full responsibilities of a Project Manager.</li>
    <li><bold>The De Facto Project Manager:</bold> The second way that one can become a project manager is more “de facto”, where, through experience you are able to rise to a position of project manager. This would be my preferred method because I believe that learning aspects of project management through various positions will benefit me more than just purely studying for a certification. I believe that there are certain aspects of project management that cannot be taught, but are more “soft skills”, such as maintaining client relationships and leading a team. These are skills that I can refine through working in other types of roles. </li>
</ol>
Overall, I think that the project management role would be ideal for me because it allows me to use my technical knowledge that I have gained from this course and my other IT courses, but it also lets me use the skills I possess and have learned in my business education.
